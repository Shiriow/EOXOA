---

Includes some Optional files which adds a multiplier to enemy stats, and others that removes Buccaneer and Alchemist level gates (just dont forget these classes are designed around having them)



Overwrite enemydata.tbl in romfs/Monster/Table/

**enemydata x1.13.tbl:** just multiples the 6 stats by 1.13x

**enemydata x1.15 non agi.tbl:** doesn't touch AGI as increased enemy AGI also makes blinsides more frequent

**enemydata xvarious.tbl:** x1.2    Str  Luc  Int     ; x1.3    Vit  Wis  ; x1.1    Agi
