Includes some Optional files which adds a multiplier to enemy stats, and others that removes Buccaneer and Alchemist level gates (just dont forget these classes are designed around having them)



Overwrite enemydata.tbl in romfs/Monster/Table/

**enemydata x1.13.tbl:** just multiples the 6 stats by 1.13x

**enemydata x1.15 non agi.tbl:** doesn't touch AGI as increased enemy AGI also makes blinsides more frequent

**enemydata xvarious.tbl:** x1.2    Str  Luc  Int     ; x1.3    Vit  Wis  ; x1.1    Agi       

**enemydata progress.tbl:** 

Randoms's modifier for the 6 stats and MaxHP increases as you get to new stratums: starts at 1.05x for S1, 1.07x S2, x1.1 S3, etc. Caps at 1.25x on S9 with AGI capping at x1.1 at S3; 

FOEs are x1.25 STAT+HP, x1.1 AGI from the start; Bosses are similar but with no HP multiplier
